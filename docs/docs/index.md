For a step by step tutorial that covers the installation process and running
the project, check [Getting started](getting_started.md).

## Structure

* **Tutorials**: take you by the hand through a series of steps to install, run and
  use this software.
* **Topic guides**: discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and
  provide useful background information and explanation.
* **Reference guides**: contain technical reference for the code. They describe
  how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding
  of key concepts.
* **How-to guides**: they guide you through the steps involved in addressing
  key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume
  some knowledge of how this software works.

  This structure is based on [Django's one](https://docs.djangoproject.com//).
  You can find more information about it on <https://documentation.divio.com/>.

Apart from this documentation, the HTTP API documentation can be found at
the API server URL in the `/docs` directory.
